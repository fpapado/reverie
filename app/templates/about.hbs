<p>
  Reverie is a web app that bla bla. Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla.
  Reverie works offline! After you have loaded the site initially, you can take notes immediatelly and access them when you come back.
  If you sign up and log in, you can sync your notes to our online service. Notes taken whilst offline will be synchronised when connectivity is restored.
  You can also opt to add reverie to your mobile home page, both via Safari and Chrome.
