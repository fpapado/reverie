<div class="lh-copy measure center">
  <p>
    Reverie is a web app for taking notes.
    Reverie works offline! After you have loaded the site initially, you can take notes immediately and access them when you come back.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the future, if you sign up and log in, you can sync your notes to our online service. Notes taken whilst offline will be synchronised once connectivity is restored.
    In addition to that, there will be a simple import/export feature if you want to back up your data without the built-in synchronisation.
    <br>
    <br>
    You can also opt to add Reverie to your smarphone's home page, both via Safari and Chrome.
